                corporations until they transformed her into their most potent
                weapon through the power of biohacking technology. Her body
                serves as the core component of Stasis, a cutting-edge quantum
                teleporter that allows Farcana's stars to avoid risking their

                Introducing Q, the last person to leave Earth. Born in the
                shadows beneath the ground, Q fled Earth as an illegal passenger
                on the last ship. Unable to see the sky above the earth, he
                strived to conquer the skies of Mars. Q vowed not to abandon
                those in distress, as the earthlings had abandoned him. His
                wings, ambitions, and maximalism led him to where any dream is
                possible - to Farcana.</span

                prosperity. He granted the planet its freedom and a place in the
                sun. But at a cost. His brutal methods of clearing Mars of
                unlawful settlers and liberating corporate lands earned his
                family a place on the planet, but he wasn't ready to give up his
                own freedom. In a bold move, he eliminated his squad of thugs,
                the last criminals on Mars, and sought a fresh start in
                Farcana—a place of redemption.

                a small village orphanage in the Philippines. From childhood, he
                had a passion for drawing, and his talent was noticed by a
                teacher who supported and inspired him to become a teacher
                himself. When the shelter where he grew up was closed, our hero
                and the other wards organized a protest. They created beautiful
                posters and kites and took to the streets. This "Colorful
                Protest" unexpectedly turned into the most massive and bloody
                riot in history. Teacher ended up in a juvenile prison, where he
                began teaching inmates drawing, literature, and history. After
                his release, he was unable to get a teaching job due to his
                criminal record. However, he continued to help street children
                by organizing free lessons in public parks.</span

                the Air Force. She had to make hard decisions all the time, and
                they didn't always have the best outcomes. She was indeed a good
                soldier, but was she a good person? Doubt began creeping
                in.</span
